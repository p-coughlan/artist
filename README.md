It provides information on the sections and features a simple form to enable users to subscribe to a mailing list and leave optional feedback or query if desired.

## User Stories
As a first-time visitor, I expect to navigate through the site with ease, view artwork in clearly defined sections, and gain an understanding of the artist's processess.

As a returning visitor, I would look to see updated galleries and information on upcoming shows or collaborative projects.

As a frequent user, I expect to easily find contact information and mailing list subscribe option so I could pose any questions and recieve information regarding future events.


## Design
The website employs a minimalist design with a 'studio' feel. The use of the white painted brick wall adds a little textural warmth.

## Color Scheme
The main colour elements come form the artwork itself. Varying greys have been used in heading elements and borders such as #111, #333 and #555. Additionally I used an eye dropper tool to pick out colours from the gallery link 'thumbnails' on the main page. These colours (#c83b27 and #3b5f9d) are used in the navigation links at the top of the page and in the copyright information in the footer.

## Typography
Fonts for the website are sourced from Google Fonts.

The font 'Bebas Neue', designed by Ryoichi Tsunekawa is used for all headings and subheadings, is a bold uppercase font that has a strong visual impact.

The font used for paragraphs and form elements is 'Lato', designed by Łukasz Dziedzic. It is similar to Gil Sans and is a very readable sans-serif font.

## Imagery
All imagery on the site is original artwork by the artsist - Patrick Coughlan. The only exception to this is the 'white painted brick wall" image that forms the background across all the pages of the site (information below in credits). Images were all resized in photoshop and saved as jpeg files generally within the 40-60kb range to ensure smoother performance of the website.

## Features

- Fully Responsive Design - The website is designed to be responsive to a variety of devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and desktop computers.

- Interactive Navigation Menu - The easy-to-use navigation menu allows users to navigate around the site with ease. It features a hover effect to encourage users to interact and navigate through the website.

- Home Page - The simple homepage uses striking circular thumbnail gallery images which offer the user to browse work by category (Printmaking, Photography and Assemblage). The gallery icons have a hover function that make the image slightly opaque when hovered over. This provides a sense of interactivity and encourages the user to click to navigate through the site.

- Favicon - created using the 'Bebas Neue' font against a background colour matched from website 'white wall' background. This will help users identify website among open tabs and make finding the site in browser history easier, also increasing familiarity.

## Roadmap

* Add 404 page
* Create a 'news' section so users can read updated information about current or upcoming shows / exhibitions
* Create an 'archive' of past or not 'immediately relevant' work
* Create sub categories as the current site only touches the surface (i.e. photography could include film based work, portraiture, studio work, conceptual work etc)
* Past Exhibitions list
